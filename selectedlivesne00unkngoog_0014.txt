PREFACE

--——

Ιτ is not the intention in the present work to prepare
simply a new edition ol Nepos; there are already good
recent editions on the market. But there is no good edi-
tion adapted to the wants ol the class ol students that this
book is intended to reach. We hear college men too often
say that Caesar is dull and uninteresting. That is a great
pity‚ for few writers are in reality so vigorous and enter·
taining. The trouble lies in their methodos studying him.
They read him so slowly and painlully that all interest in
the progress ol his narrative is lost. We believe it would
be far better lor the beginner to use lor his earliest drill
in reading a work in which the lagging interest might be
revived at frequent intervals. For this purpose Nepos is

ι admirably adapted. Each lile is a complete story in itsell.

After a number of these have been read it may fairly be
presumed that the student will be able to read Caesar with
more ease and appreciation. The language of Nepos is
usually simple-il studiedly so, no matter-and his style is
never difficolt. We believe no classical author is better
adapted to the needs of beginners than Nepos. Ἴ

In the present work th'e shorter lives have been arranged
first. The notes to them are very full and simple, and
dwell on many familiar points of grammar. It is hoped
