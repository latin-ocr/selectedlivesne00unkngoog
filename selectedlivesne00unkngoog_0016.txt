INTRODUCTION

1. Line os Nenos

Conwnnrvs Nenos was born some tirne in the early part
oi the last century Β. c.; the exact date is not recorded.
His birthplaee was a town (ol which we do not know the
name) ol northern Italy, in the valley ol the Po. He early
removed to Rome, however, where he spent most oi his
lile. He lived to a good old age, and died some time after
27 a. e. These are brief and inexact facts, but they eon·
tain the most that we know of the events of Nepos’s lile.
As to his station in life, we are told that he was an eques.
Since this rank was determined upon a census oi at least
400‚ooo sesterces (about 317900), we know that Nepos had
sufficient means to live in comfort without having recourse
to business or public or professional lile. He was an inti-
mate friend of the greatest literary geniuses of his age,
particularly Cicero, Catullus the poet, and Atticus the
scholar and antiquary. This, together with what we
know ol his writings and the fact that he is never men·
tioned in connection with any office or public event, makes
it reasonably certain that he lived the life of a cultivated
manos letters, withdrawn from the active pursuits ol the
world but attached to that which was highest in cultivated

tastu in scholarship, and in literature.
