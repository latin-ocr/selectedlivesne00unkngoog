CORNELII NEPOTlS

2. His Wrurmcs

Nepos was a student oi antiquities and biography. The
most ot his writings have been lost; those that are pre-
served belong to the held of biography. They include
one book oi Lines of Emincnt Foro'gn Leoders‚ containing
twenty-two short biographies, to which is appended abrici
chapter on Kings, and, in addition, two biographies taken
from a book oi Lioes of Roman Historiam. We know from
various references found in Latin authors that these two
books formed part ol a considerable series; that he wrote
what we may call au encyclopaedia oi biography in as many
as sixteen books. He seems to have divided his subjects
into eight classes-kings, generals, statesmen‚ orators,
poets, historians, philosopherS, and grammarians-and to
have devoted two books to each class. Ol each pair· oi
books, the first contained the lives of foreigners, particu-
larly Greeks; the second was devoted to Roman subjects

With regard to his other writings, we have little infor·
mation. We learn that he wrote considerable works on
Roman antiquities,a book on geography, lives ol Cicero
and Cato, and some love poems. Our knowledge ol these
works is so scanty that we c'an form no estimato of their
quality.

Cicero and Caesar. For that reason, il lor no other, he is
