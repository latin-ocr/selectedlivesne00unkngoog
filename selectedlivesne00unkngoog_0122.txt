14. cui: “to him.” The relative at the beginning of a sentence is fre-
quently used instead of a demonstrative. It has no relative force in
its own sentence, but is used merely to make a closer connection with
what has gone before.

14. respondit: governs indirect discourse. The principal verbs must be
in the infinitive and in the same tense as theman actually used. The
subordinate verbs must be subjunctive and follow the rule for sequence
of tenses, depending on respondit.

15. laborasset: = labiudvisset.

18. sexto anno quam: ‘⁴ in the sixth year after,” or in better English,
“six years after.'’ anno· is abl. of time when. quam = postquam.
nost is frequently omitted after definite expressions of time.
