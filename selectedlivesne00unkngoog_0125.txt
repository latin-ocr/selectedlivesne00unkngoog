‘⁴ desiring to marry her.''

11. Callias quIdam: “a man-by the name oi Callias.’'

13. ut sibi daret: “that he [Cimon] should give to him [Callias].” The
reflexive ribi refers back to the subject oi e'git in the main clause.

13. impetrisset = impetravisset: aiut. condition in ind. disc. depending
on a secondary verb 01 saying implied in e'git. The apodosis solata-
rum decides that it is a lut. condition. impetrasset may stand t'or

1. primurn imperator: “at first, as general ''; contrast iterum impe-
rtitor, below, “the second time he was made general.”

1. Strymona: Gk. acc. oi 3d decl. This battle 01 the Strymon
occurred in 476 nc. With regard to the next two historic events

referred to, Nepos is very much in error. The attempted founding 01 Ῐ ’

Amphipolis by10‚000Athenians occurred in 467‚·but was not con-
ducted by Cimon. The battle 01 Mycale was in 479 Β. c., in which
the Greeks under Leotychides and Xanthippus were victorious.
Nepos means evidently not the battle 01 Mycale, but the battle os the
Eurymedon in 469 Β. c. At any rate, Nepos has not mentioned the
events in their chronological order.

4. Cypriorum et Phoenicum: it was a Persian fleet composed oi
Cyprian and Phoenician tributaries.

5. revictam cepit: translate: “he defeated and captured.’'
