uus

but for him would have been postponed. Marathon was the first
great battle in which the Greeks met and defeated vastly superior
numbers of the Persians.

1. antiquitite, gloria, modestii: ahl. of cause. Miltiades traced his
descent from Aeacus, the son of Zeus.

3. rinus omnium maxime floreret: a strong superlative 3 “he was the
most eminent man of all.” The subj. of flire‘rct is Miltiadis, although
it stands before cum.

3. ei aetite: abl. of quality followedby the result clause ut . . . pos-
sent.

4. cives sui: instead of sui we should expect iius. lt is quite unusual
to find the reflexive referring to some one else than the subj. sui
refers to the same person as ea· in the same clause, and should be the

. same pronoun.

5. eum futurum (esse) : ind. disc. depending on spirare and cinfidere.

5. iudicirunt = indicaverunt.

5. cognitum: pass. part. agreeing with eum understood, the object of
iudicarunt. “They were confident that he would prove to be such a
man as they (actually) estimated (him to be when he became) known
(to them later).'’ The concise style of the Latin is obscure. cigni-
tum is equivalent to a temporal clause, cum eum cognovissent.

6. accidit ut: “it chanced that.” This is the main independent verb
of the whole long sentence. Nepos's style in this sentence is very

poor. He has got too far away at the end from the thought with
which he started.

6. Chersonesum: acc. of motion. By the rule in Lat. the acc. without
the prep. is restricted to names of towns and islands, but the con-
struction is occasionally extended to other Greek place names that
end in -us, The whole account given in this and the following chap-
ter, with the exception of the acquisition of Lemnos, is a mistake on
the part of Nepos. The Miltiades who is the subject of the present
life had an uncle of the same name, and it was he who led the colony
to Chersonese, and about whom the Delphian oracle was delivered.

7. cuius generis: “since there was a great number of this kind (of
people)”; namely. men ready to undertake a colonizing expedition.

9. unlneratum: former supine, ‘¹ to consult the oracle.”

9. quo duce uterentur: ind. quest. depending on deliberatum.

10. duce: in appos. with qui.

11. erat dimicandum: second periphrastic, impers. ς trans. as an active.

12. his consulentibus: ind. obj. of μωρίη “the priestess informed
them when they consulted her.”
