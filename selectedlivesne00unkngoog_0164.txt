NOTES

unz

11. Vlll. reditum est: impers.; translate personally.

13. εδ, sui: refer to the subj. 01 permisit.

13. iactum: sc. esse, impera, followedby the result clause ut . . . oboe-
dirent.

15. responsurum: “would make a defense.”

16. quid diceret: ind. quest.. “ anything to say.”

18. criminI: dat. 01 purpose. W. 3433 B. 191. 13 A. G. 233. a; Η.
433· 3·

23. Leuctra: the battle 01 Leuctra had been fought in 271, hence not
during the expedition when Epaminondas exceeded his term 01 office.
Nepos makes a still greater error a few lines further on when he says

’ that the Thebans besieged Sparta. That event did not occur till 362,
and so, 01 course, could not have been cited by Epaminondas at this
time.

24. ante εδ impetitorem: “besore his generalship”; εἰ irregularly
refers to the subject 01 neultdtus αῖς we should expect eum in·
stead.

30. Messene restituti: Messene had long been a dependency 01 Sparta.
Epaminondas restored to it its original freedom.

4. tx. Mantineam: 362 ac.

5. cognitusi: cumque cognosceretur. We expect cognitus to agree
with the subject 01 the verb; instead 01 that, Nepos uses a plural
verb, ficerunt, with subj. Lacedaemonii· understood. Hence cignitus
has no construction at all.

6. 11 unius pernicie eius: “upon the death 01 him alone '’; anius is
made emphatic by its position.

20. X. ln quo: “on this point.”

22. diceret: governed hyram, but the subject is Pelopidas. Such change
01 subject in parallel clauses is very poor style.

24. qui . . . relicturus sis: a relative clause expressing cause. W.
586.4;,Β. 283. 3: A. G. 320.e; H: 592.

24. 0111ξ1ἑ111111 “son” The Latin 0110101 uses the simple abl. 01
source with ndtus. W. 378; Β. 215ς Α. G. 244. ας Η. 469. 1.

27. quae . . . sitt a clause 01 result aiter necesse est nith ut omitted.
W. 523: Β. 295. 8; Α. G. 332· 2: H. 564. Il. 1.

30. domo se tenuit: ‘⁴ stayed in his house.'’ Much commonet than the
abl. alone is the loc. domi or in (ἰωνιᾶς donari is abl. 01 place where.

W. 40²3 8108, 1. ὸς Α, G. 258. f. 1; H. 485.
