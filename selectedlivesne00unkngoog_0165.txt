1. 1. Agesilius, King of Sparta, was born about 440 Β. c. He became
king iu 398, and in 396-394 conducted the war in Asia Minor which
Nepos speaks of. In 394 he won the decisive battle os Coronea
against the allied Greek forces. lle died in the winter of 361-360 in
Egypt, wbither he had gone with a body of Spartan mercenaries.
He was one of the ablest military leaders that Sparta ever had.

better known as the historian who wrote the Anabasis and the Helle·

their chief functions were religious and military.

the Heraclidae. In early times they had led the Dorians into Pelo-

his sons the Spartan state was allotted. But he had left twins, Pro-
cles and Eurysthenes, and tlre people, being unwilling to distinguish
between them, made both kings, and continued a double succession

from the family of each.

8. qui principes: “who were the first of tlre Heraclidae to be kings at
Sparta.” princeps, from primus and capia, seems to have meant
originally ‘¹ the first to take, the beginner,” and is used nearly in that
sense here,
